  # nasty nasty nasty hack for setting artifact version

  #####################################################################
  #
  # since omnibus-ruby is not architected to intentionally let the
  # software definitions define the #build_version and
  # #build_iteration of the package artifact, we're going to implement
  # a temporary hack here that lets us do so. this type of use case
  # will become a feature of omnibus-ruby in the future, but in order
  # to get things shipped, we'll hack it up here.
